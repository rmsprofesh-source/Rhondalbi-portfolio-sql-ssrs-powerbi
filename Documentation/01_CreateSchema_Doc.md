# Script 01 — Database & Schema Creation

## What This Script Does
Script 01 creates the HR Analytics database and defines the complete schema. It builds all core tables — employees, departments, job titles, salary history, job history, training, skills, and performance appraisals. It also sets up the primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships needed for reporting and analytics.

## How It Works
The script:

- Creates the database and assigns the HR schema  
- Builds each table  
- Defines relationships through foreign keys  


## Role in the Workflow
This script must run first. It creates the structure that lookup values and employee generation depend on.
