## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases a real, production-style Business Intelligence project built entirely by me, demonstrating SQL engineering, SSRS report development, and end-to-end BI solution design.

It currently includes:

- A fully scripted **SQL Server 2022 HR Analytics database**
- Automated **stored procedures** for headcount, tenure, and retention metrics
- A completed **SSRS paginated report** (Employee Tenure Detail Report)
- Supporting documentation and images

**All HR data in this project is fully synthetic and programmatically generated.**

Additional components—including Power BI, SSIS ETL workflows, and extended documentation—will be added as the portfolio continues to grow.
